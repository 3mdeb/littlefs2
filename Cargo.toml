# HACK TL;DR :sadface: we are using an older version here to avoid
# rust-lang/cargo#4361 which has been fixed in nightly but lives behind a
# unstable flag as of Rust 1.42.0
#
# longer explanation: this crate depends on bindgen (build dependency) and
# bindgen depends on `memchr` "2" with default features enabled, which include a
# "std" feature that makes the crate depend on `std`. `cstr_core` ">0.1.1" and
# "0.2" also depend on "memchr" but with default features disabled. As this
# crate depends on both it ends up enabling the "std" of the `memchr` crate
# (that's the bug because that shouldn't happen).
#
# To avoid `bindgen` enabling the "std" dependency of `memchr` "2" we use an
# older version of `cstr_core` that depends on version of "1" of `memchr`. This
# way the bug won't enable the "std" of `memchr` "1" (because `memchr` "1" and
# `memchr` "2" are considered different crates)

# TODO: LFS_NAME_MAX (and maybe other sizes) are baked into the
# compiled C library. For instance, the `lfs_info` struct has a
# member `char name[LFS_NAME_MAX+1]`.
# This means that if we change `traits::Storage::FILENAME_MAX_PLUS_ONE`,
# we need to pass this on!
